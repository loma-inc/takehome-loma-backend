# Loma Take Home
Loma enables "click-to-deploy" commerce for online communities. Our platform lets any community organizer launch lightweight commerce rails for its members, including models like peer-to-peer marketplaces, sponsored classifieds, and directories.

## Project Goal
The goal of this assignment is to create a flexible marketplace architecture which can handle the creation of a listing for both a sneaker marketplace and a hotel booking platform.

You are encouraged to work in the language/framework of your choosing. This repository is provided as a starting point, but its not required that you use it. We are more interested in your design using tools familiar to you than your ability to use Python/Django.

Build the necessary models and endpoint(s) for creating a listing.
If you are using this repository, the models should live in `marketplace/api/models.py` and the endpoint(s) in `marketplace/api/views.py`.

It is expected that you will spend up to 4 hours on this project. The intent is to replace several traditional "onsite" interviews and coding sessions with one project that is done on your own time in an environment that is more similar to your usual setup.

## Assessment
We'll be looking at the design and architecture of your solution, including how you structure your code and your approach to data modeling. Don't be afraid to get creative!

## Submission
Submit a link to a GitHub (or other) repository, or zip file via email to sean@loma.tech. Please provide a README that briefly explains your solution and any decisions that you would like to highlight.

Don't hesitate to reach out to sean@loma.tech if you have any questions.
